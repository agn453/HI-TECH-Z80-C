Object Code Format

1.  Introduction

	This describes the format of the object code recognized by the 
linker "link". Note that later versions of the object code have 
identifying  version  numbers  in  IDENT  records. Early  version of the 
object code did not have these version numbers. The presence of the 
version number  can  be  determined  from the length of the ident record. 
Certain features will be identified as being present in versions greater 
than some value by the notation (>=m.n) where m is the major version 
number and n is the minor version number, e.g. (>=2.1).

2.  Object Code Structure

	The object code (OCODE) is essentially binary, comprising a sequence 
of records, each with an outer envelope thus:

| Length (16 bits) | Record type (8 bits) | Data (Length*8 bits) |

i.e. a 16 bit length, followed by an 8 bit type, then a sequence of 
8 bit bytes.  The length is the number of bytes, exluding the length and 
type.  In practice, the length of the data portion of any record will
not exceed 512 bytes. This places an upper limit on the size of the
buffer required to hold any record.

2.1.  TEXT Record

	The major record type is TEXT (== 1). Its format (i.e. the data 
part of the basic record envelope) is thus:

| Offset (32 bits) | Psect name (null term.) | data bytes |

	The Offset is the offset (in bytes) within the named psect (i.e. 
program section) at which the data bytes are to be placed.  The name, 
like all names in this OCODE, is null terminated.  The number of data 
bytes is found by subtracting the length of the name + 4 from the record 
length in the outer envelope.

2.2.  PSECT Record

	The PSECT (== 2) record is used to define program sections. Each 
PSECT record describes one psect.

| Psect flags (16 bits) | psect name (null terminated) |

	Note that as a consistency check, the null byte terminating the 
name must be the last byte in the record. The flag bits are:

GLOBAL  020	Psect is global
PURE	040	Psect is to be read-only
OVRLD	0100	Each modules data for this psect starts at
		relative location 0. The default is concatenation. ABS
	0200	This psect is to be loaded at absolute 0.
BIGSEG  0400	Means the relocatibility of this psect is
		multiplied by 65535
BPAGE	01000	This is a base page psect - ignore overflows in
		relocations

2.3.  RELOC Record

	The RELOC (== 3) type record contains relocation information 
relating to the last TEXT record. It consists of a sequence of 
offset/descriptor pairs, the offset being a 16 bit offset within the 
last TEXT record, and the descriptor providing the relocation 
information. The type of the relocation may be simple relocation 
within a psect, relocation by the value of an external name, or whatever. 
Complex relocations may also appear, which are a sequence of operators 
and operands, to be evaluated by a stack machine. Each simple relocation 
record will appear as:

| Offset (16 bits) | Reloc. type (8 bits) | Psect or external name |

	The name is, as usual, null terminated. The actual RELOC record
consists of an arbitrary number of these entries.  The relocation type
byte is interpreted as follows:

bits		|7    4|3    0|
		| type | size |

The size is the size in bytes of the quantity to be relocated. The type 
is one of:

RABS	0	Absolute - no relocation (i.e. no change)
RPSECT  1	Relocation within named psect
RNAME	2	Relocation by value of name
RRPSECT 5	Relocation within psect, less the current pc.
		This is required for machines using relative addressing. 
		val = val + psect.base - code.location
RRNAME  6	As for RRPSECT, but relative to a symbol rather than a
		psect.
RSPSECT 9	Relocation by the segment value for the psect
RSNAME  10	Relocation by the segment value for the symbol
RCPLX	48	Complex relocation follows

	A complex relocation entry has, in place of the name, a sequence of 
operator bytes and operand bytes with further information. Where binary 
operations are performed, the top stack entry is the left hand operand,
and the next to top stack value is the right hand operand.  Both values
are removed from the stack and the result pushed back on.  Unary operators
act on the top stack value.  Operands like RC_VAL and RPSECT push their
value onto the stack.  The possible type bytes are as follows:

RC_END  0	End of complex relocations
RC_LOW  1	And with 0xFF
RC_HI	2	Right shift 8 bits, and with 0xFF
RC_VAL  3	32 bit constant follows
RC_ADD  4	Addition
RC_SUB  5	Subtraction
RC_MUL  6	Multiplication
RC_DIV  7	Division
RC_SHL  8	Shift left
RC_SHR  9	Shift right
RC_AND  10	Bitwise AND
RC_OR	11	Bitwise OR
RC_XOR  12	Bitwise XOR
RC_CPL  13	Bitwise complement
RC_NEG  14	Negate
RC_BITF 15	Bitfield extract - operands are
		value, bit offset, and length 
RPSECT  16	Value of psect - null-terminated name follows
RC_MOD  17	Modulus
RNAME	32	Value of symbol - null-terminated name follows
RSPSECT 144	Segment selector of psect
RSNAME  160	Segment selector of symbol

2.4.  SYM Record

	The SYM (== 4) record defines external and internal names.  It 
consists of a sequence of name definitions. Note that it is not essential 
to mention an external name here if it is referenced in a RELOC record. 
Each entry is as follows:

| Value (32 bits) | flags (16 bits) | psect name | symbol name |

Note that the psect name will be null if the symbol is not being 
defined.  That is, the psect name will be a single null byte.  The 
flag word contains the same flags as defined above for PSECT records. 
In the low order 4 bits is one of the following values:

NULL	0	The normal case when defining local or global symbols
STACK	1	Symbol is a stack (auto variable) symbol
COMM	2	Symbol is a common symbol - if it is defined elsewhere
		then this is the same as EXTERN, otherwise the linker 
		will allocate space in the psect named, of size equal to 
		the maximum value of any instance of this symbol 
		encountered.
REGNAM  3	Symbol refers to a register
LINENO  4	This is a line number in the source code
FILNAM  5	This is the name of a source file
EXTERN  6	This is a reference to an externally defined symbol
		The psect name must be null.

	STACK, REGNAM, FILNAM and LINENO symbols are purely for
use by a debugger.  These symbols are not handled by the linker at  
all (other than to correctly relocate their values) but will be 
passed through to a symbol table unless suppressed with a -x option.

2.5.  START Record

	The START (== 5) record defines a start address.  Only one START 
record may appear in a module.

| offset (32 bits) | psect name (null term) |

This defines the start address to be at the specified offset
in the named psect.

2.6.  END Record

	The END (== 6) record is as follows:

| flags (16 bits) |

The flag value is currently unused.

2.7.  IDENT Record

	The IDENT (= 7) record identifies the target machine and 
specifies the ordering of bytes in 32 and 16 bit quantities. This 
affects both offset and symbol values as well as relocatable values in 
TEXT records. The IDENT record is optional, and the default ordering 
is strictly low byte first.  If the IDENT record is present, it must 
be the first record in the file. The length field in every record's 
outer envelope is always stored low byte first, irrespective of the 
content of any IDENT record.

| byte order (32 bits) | byte order (16 bits) | machine name | version 
		number (16 bits) |

	The byte order fields list the relative position of successively 
more significant bytes within fields of 32 and 16 bits respectively. For 
example, the ident record for a PDP11 would look like this:

| 02 03 00 01 | 00 01 | PDP11  |

	The machine name is null terminated. The ident record need not be 
present, if more than one ident record is encountered, all records 
must have identical byte ordering. The version number (>=2.0) 
occupies 2 bytes after the machine name.  This is present only if the 
record length is long enough to contain these extra 2 bytes. If 
absent, the version number may be assumed to be 1.0.  If present, the 
first byte is the major version number, and the second the minor 
version number.

2.8.  XPSECT Record

The XPSECT (==8) record contains further information about a psect. 
Some object files may not contain any XPSECT records. The layout is as 
follows:

| max size (32 bits) | relocatability (16 bits) | selector (16 bits) | 
		reserved (24 bits) | type (8 bits) | psect name |

	The max size field is a long integer specifying the maximum size of 
this psect. The relocatability field, if non-zero, specifies a boundary
 on which the psect must start, e.g. for the 8086 this field is usually
16, since 8086 segment must start on a 16 byte boundary.

	The reserved field should be all zeros. The psect name is the 
null terminated name of the psect. The selector (>=2.0) is non-zero 
if there is a segment selector to be associated with this psect. 
This feature is normally only used with segmented architecture processors 
like the 8086. In object code versions prior to 2.0 this field was 
always
zero.
	The type field (>=2.1) allows the linker to verify that all 
module's contributions to a given psect are of the same type. This field 
must match in all modules for this psect. This is typically used by 
the 8086 assembler to encode the state of the USE32 flag for a psect.

2.9.  SEGMENT Record

	The SEGMENT (== 9) record (>= 2.0) is present in fully linked 
object files only, i.e. those produced by the linker. This defines a 
segment, which is a contiguous set of psects. The record structure is as 
follows:

| size (32 bits) | base address (32 bits) | selector (16 bits) 
	| reserved (16 bits) | origin (32 bits) | segment name |

	The size field is the size of the segment in bytes. The base 
address is the physical base address of the segment. This is not 
necessarily the same as the origin, which is the addresse used when 
references to this segment were relocated. These correspond to the 
load and link addresses respectively of the psects comprising the 
segment.
	The selector is the segment selector value used in referring 
to this segment. This is of relevance mainly for 8086 family processors. 
The segment name is the name of the first psect comprising this segment.

2.10.  XSYM Record

	The XSYM (== 10) record (>= 2.1) is similar to the SYM record but 
also defines a selector value for the symbol. The record layout is as 
follows:

| value (32 bits) | flags (16 bits) | selector (16 bits) | name |

The selector value is the selector of the segment
within which the symbol is located.

2.11.  SIGNAT Record

	The SIGNAT (== 11) record (>=2.1) defines a signature for a 
symbol. At link time all signatures for a symbol are compared and must be 
identical. If a signature is not the same, an error message is 
issued. The record layout is as follows:

| signature (16 bits) | symbol name |

2.12.  FNINFO Record

	The FNINFO (== 12) record (>= 2.3) provides information necessary 
for call-graphing and local data allocation for non-reentrant 
functions. Within a record are concatenated one or more instances 
of the following layouts.  Each instance is variable length, depending 
on name lengths.

| FNCALL (1)  | caller name | callee name |
| FNARG (2)   | caller name | callee name |
| FNINDIR (3) | caller name | callee signature (16 bits) |
| FNADDR (4)  | function name | signature (16 bits) |
| FNSIZE (5)  | func name | local size (32 bits) | arg size (32 bits) |
| FNROOT (6)  | func name |

	The FNCALL instance specifies that one function directly 
calls another.  The FNARG instance specifies that one function will have 
arguments built while another is called. The FNINDIR instance 
specifies that a function calls indirectly another (unknown) function, 
whose signature is as specified.  The FNADDR instance specifies that the 
function has its address taken (and is thus a candidate for being 
called indirectly) and its signature.
	The FNSIZE instance specifies the local variable block size and 
the argument block size for a function. The FNROOT instance specifies 
that this function is the root of a call graph (either the main function 
or an interrupt function).

2.13.  FNCONF Record

	The FNCONF (== 13) record (>=2.3) provides environmental 
information for call-graphing and local data allocation purposes. The 
layout comprises three null-terminated strings as follows:
| psect name | local data prefix | argument prefix |
The psect name is the name of the psect in which local data and 
argument blocks should be allocated by the linker. The local data and 
argument prefixes are the strings which should be prepended to a 
function name to derive the names for the local data and argument blocks 
for a given function.

3.  NOTES

	No padding or fill bytes are stored in the object file, i.e. no 
alignment of the records is done. Do not attempt to read or write 
object files using structures,  i.e. all records must be built up 
byte-by-byte in a char array.
