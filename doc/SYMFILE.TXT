HI-TECH C

Symbol File Format

Introduction

The symbol files produced by the HI-TECH linker using the -h option are
ascii files, organized as one symbol per line. Other lines provide
information about modules etc.
 
Global Symbols

The first part of the file comprises global symbols, i.e symbols visible
throughout the entire program. Each line has the symbol name, a space
then one or two hex numbers separated by a space.

The first hex number is the link value of the symbol, i.e. the value
that will be substituted whenever the symbol is referenced in the code.
If the symbol is absolute, this will be the only number on the line.
If a second value appears, this is the difference between the link and
load addresses of the symbol. The load address of a symbol is the
address at which it appears in the code image produced by the linker.
If the link and load addresses are the same, this value will be zero.
Some examples:

_main 100 0

This line defines a symbol _main (note that the C compiler prepends an
underscore to all C symbols) with a link address of 100 hex and the
same load address.

_bios_ram 0 400

This symbol has a link address of 0, and a load address of 400 hex. In
the context of an 8086 processor this would be interpreted as a
segemented address of 40:0 (the load address is a linear address).

Psect Limits

Within the global symbols will appear some symbols generated by the
linker which give information about the limits of psects (program
sections, sometimes called segments). Every psect in the program
will have at least two symbols defined for it. The names of these
symbols are formed by prepending the strings __L and __H to the psect
name. The values of these are the low and high bounds of the psect
respectively. For example, the psect "text" would have the symbols
__Ltext and __Htext defined.  These may appear as follows:

__Ltext 100 0
__Htext 157 0

This specifies that the text psect starts at 100 hex and has a length
of 57 hex bytes. Its load and link addresses are the same. 
Another example:

__Lbss 560 270
__Hbss 840 270

This indicates that the bss psect starts at 560 hex and extends to
83F hex. Note the non-zero second number. This means that the link
and load addresses are different. In 8086 real mode the segmented
address 27:560 could be used to refer to the base of this bss psect
(though numerous other addresses would also refer to the same
location).  If the link and load addresses for a psect are different,
there will also be another symbol defined, formed by prefixing __B
to the psect name. This symbol will be given a value equal to the
load address of the psect less the base of the psect. In the above
example, __Bbss would be set to 270.

Local Symbols

The end of the global symbol list is flagged by the line

%locals

All symbols after this line are local symbols, i.e. they are visible
only to the module in which they are defined. Symbol lines will
generally be the same in form as global symbols, i.e. a name
followed by one or two hex numbers. In addition, lines will appear
with a file name and no hex numbers, e.g.

fred.obj

would appear immediately before the symbols defined in the module
fred. Within the module fred there will be one or more source files.
The names of these source files may also appear, e.g.

fred.obj
fred.c
_fred 0 A0
_bill 140 A0
george.c
_george 276 A0

This example indicates that the source file fred.c defined the two
symbols _fred and _bill, then included another file george.c which
defined the symbol _george. Absolute symbols may also appear in the
local symbol area. The order of symbols and modules is preserved.

Line Numbers

If line numbers are included in the object code, these appear in the
same form as described above, but the symbol name is a number, e.g.

fred.obj
fred.c
10 4 D0
11 8 D0
12 10 D0

defines a module fred.obj, derived from the file fred.c, and with
lines 10, 11 and 12 producing code. The addresses are the addresses
of the first executable code from that line.

A Full Example

An example is given here of a small C source file, and the resultant
symbol file and link map. The C source is test.c, as follows:

#include	<stdio.h>
#include	<conio.h>

static int	fred;
main()
{
	fred = 23;
	putch('x');
	return 1;
}



The resultant symbol file is:


_main E01C 0
_exit E019 0
start E000 0
__Hbss 8006 0
__Lbss 8004 0
_getch E06D 0
_kbhit E063 0
_putch E047 0
__Hdata E093 0
__Ldata E093 0
__Htemp 8004 0
__Ltemp 8000 0
__Htext E093 0
_getche E084 0
__Ltext E000 0
__Hstack 8800 0
__Lstack 8800 0
__Hvectors 10000 0
__Lvectors 0 0
_init_uart E031 0
%locals
test.c
6 E01C 0
7 E01E 0
8 E024 0
9 E029 0
10 E02E 0
_fred 8004 0
ctemp 8000 0


The link map generated at the same time is:

 Linker command line:

-w80 -z -H -Mmap -ptext=0e000h,data,temp=08000h,bss,stack=08800h \
  -o/usr/tmp/eaaa20022 /usr/hitech/lib/crt09.obj \
  test.obj \
  /usr/hitech/lib/09libc.lib
