*** CC - improved control program for HiTech-C and msx-dos2

The program cc.com executes the passes to compile a  C-program  with
HiTech-C automatically. The c.com from Hi-Tech does  the  same,  but
cc.com has the following advantages:

 - cc.com does not use a batchfile and stops if a pass has failed
 - cc.com sets the append-variable so that your source can  be  in  a
   different directory than the compiler.

* How to install

First you need to install MSX-DOS2. Then get the HI-TECH Z80 CP/M  C
Compiler from  ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/msx/programming/c/hitech-?.pma
and unpack with pmext. HiTech has been so kind to  grant  permission
to   use   their   C-compiler   free    of    charge,    see    also
http://www.htsoft.com/products/CPM.php . 

Unpack cc.lzh to the directory that contains the C-compiler.

You should get the following files:

cc.com		- replacement for c.com
libdos2.lib	- IO-library using msx-dos2, source is in libdos.lzh 
vsh1.o		)   variants of crt.o for
vsh2.o          ) - programs executing other programs
vsh3.o		)   see vsh.txt for details
vsh.txt		- text about vsh?.o
redir.obj	- used in a work-around for -U bug in link.com 
cc.txt		- this text 
cc.c 		- source for cc.com
vshrt.as 	- source for vsh?.o
redir.as	- source for redir.obj
makefile
pack.bat

* Using cc

You can invoke CC with:

cc <options> <files>

The following options are recognised:

-C	       : keep the object file; do not link
-CR[file]      : produce cross refenerence file
-O             : optimise assembly code generated by CGEN with OPTIM
-O<file>       : put output in <file>
-I<dir>        : passed to CPP  as  extra  search-path  for  include
                 files, only works for drives, the  directory  where
                 cc.com is stored  is  always  searched  via  APPEND
                 environment variable
-V	       : verbose mode, print out commands of subprocesses
-F<file>       : write symbol file
-U<sym>        : undefine symbol for CPP
-D<sym>[=<def>]: define symbol for CPP
-S             : keep assembly file; do not assemble or link
-X             : strip local symbols, also passed to LINK
-P<pspec>      : define order of psect (not normally needed)
-M<file>       : write map file
-W<n>          : width for map file
-l<xx>	       : pass lib<xx>.lib to LINK, order is important

All options are case insensitive.

files:

Files with no extension get the extension ".c". Files with extension
".c" are treated as C language  sourcefiles.  Files  with  extension
".as" are treated as assembly assembly language  source  files.  All
other files are passed directly to the linker.

* Environment item

VSHTOP: If set, VSHTOP specifies the first page of video memory that
	will not be used or probed by CC. Pages  0..7  are  ordinary
	video memory, pages 8..11 are  the  extended  video  memory.
	Legal values are 2..12, default  is  12.  Other  values  are
	silently ignored. If VSHTOP is 2, CC will not work.
	You can use this to protect data in higher pages. 
	Some emulators may need vshtop=8.

* Notes

CC.COM uses video memory for temporary storage, so it  will  corrupt
the contents of a ramdisk that also uses video memory. 
The screen will flash between the  compilation  steps,  this  is  to
improve reliability of  reading/writing  from/to  video  memory  and
should not be cause for concern. 

HiTech-C cannot handle large C-files. This is not a  real  problem;
just split your program in to C-files of about 6 or 7 kB. The  MAKE
program by Arnold metselaar can be used with CC.com to compile only
those modules that need to be recompiled.

* Authors

CC.C is based on work by HiTech and Pierre Gielen. Arnold Metselaar
added the code to execute a subprogram and then continue  the  main
program.
